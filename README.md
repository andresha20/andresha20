# Greetings, I'm Andr√©s Henao Alzate (https://www.linkedin.com/in/andresha20/)

- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @andresha20
- :blue_book: I study accounting at Polit√©cnico Jaime Isaza Cadavid but I love coding.
- :eyeglasses: I have been programming for over 2 years and a half now, and I can confidently say that programming is my main passion. 
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm simply having a good time creating diverse stuff and wrapping my head around multiple technologies to eventually build something iconic. The technologies I feel the most confident with are the MERN & NEXT.JS stack (I've worked with this stack for 1+ years on truly difficult tasks), but I'm able to learn anything with ease and commitment. I like the minimalism of Angular compared to React and I enjoy the challenges of Java. I wish I had known Typescript earlier. Looking forth into learning Swift and React Native.

# Technologies I've worked and feel confident with

If I was told to develop something using any of these technologies, I'd do it satisfactorily:
